    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital
      machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to 
      transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. A 
      complete IoT system integrates four distinct components: sensors/devices, connectivity, data 
      processing, and a user interface, These are:-</p><ul><li>Sensor/Device</li>
      <li>Conectivity</li>
      <li>Data Processing</li>
      <li>User Interface</li></ul>
    
<h2>Sensor/Device </h2>
</p>sensors or devices collect data from their environment. This could be as simple as a temperature 
reading or as complex as a full video feed. We use sensors/devices, because multiple sensors can be 
bundled together or sensors can be part of a device that does more than just sense things.</p> 
<h2>Conectivity</h2>
 <p>After use of sensor or device the information needs to be transferred, sensors/devices can be 
     connected to the cloud through a variety of methods including: cellular, satellite, WiFi, Bluetooth, 
     low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), or connecting directly to the internet via ethernet.</p>
<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>Once the data gets to the cloud, software performs some kind of processing on it. This could be very
   simple, such as checking that the temperature reading is within an acceptable range.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>Next the information is made useful to the end-user in some way. This could be via an alert to the 
    user (email, text, notification, etc). This also allow them to proactively check in on the system.
    </p>
<h1>IoT Trends</h1>
<p>IoT trends differ from every year to a year, IoT follows a trends that goes well with every societies 
    and that's happening in the world, This year IoT focus on core needs such as health-and-safety 
    efforts and equipment monitoring, but IoT in customer experience will also develop. Several trends 
    continue to gather momentum, fueling IoT’s prominence in 2021, from data-intensive experiences that 
    use Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as self-driving cars or wearable devices) to basic 
    health-and-safety needs as COVID-19 continues to take center stage. The basic IoT trend that mainly focus on are:-

 <dd><dt>Connectivity chaos</dt><dl>Other than 5G There will be a variety of options, and organizations 
     will really have to think about what use cases they will pursue and what connectivity option makes 
     the most sense.</dl></dd>
<dd><dt>Connected device makers</dt><dl>will double down on health care. COVID-19 brought digital and 
    remote health care to the fore.The willingness has gone up to use wearables for [regular health 
    checkups and to provide virtual care.</dl></dd>
<dd><dt>Smart building technology</dt><dl>will drive employee transformation. smart building technology 
    will center more on core priorities, such as worker health and safety, this also be in  works for 
    social distancing to decrease COVID 19.</dl></dd>
<dd><dt>Connected machines</dt><dl>will become ubiquitous. manufacturing plants and other environments 
    with costly machinery have now experienced the virtues of remote, Because of the pandemic, there
     were fewer people on the plant lines,” Pelino said. “Having remote monitoring capabilities became 
     much more prevalent, and those that never activated remote monitoring previously have now turned on 
     those capabilities</dl></dd>
<dd><dt>Consumer and employee location data</dt><dl>will be core to convenience.  Retail stores began to 
    explore curbside pickup and other location-based services in the wake of COVID-19, and the use of 
    location data to enhance customer service will only continue. The idea is to use information about 
    location: GPS capabilities in phones. Over time, there will be more opportunities to create location-based 
    experiences to interact with a brand.</dl></dd>
<h1>IoT Device Example And Application </h1><ul><li>Amazon Echo and Google Home</li>
<li>Fitbit Charge 3 - Wearables</li>
<li>Barcelona - Smart Cities</li>
<li>AT&T - Connected Car</li></ul>
<h2>Amazon Echo and Google Home - Smart Home</h2>
<p>AI voice assistants for example Alexander like the Amazon Echo and Google Home are some of the most
     popular connected devices in consumer IoT that uses voice to communicate.</p>
<h2>Fitbit Charge 3 - Wearables</h2>
<p>The Fitbit Charge 3 tracks your steps, floors climbed, calories burned, and sleep quality. The device 
    also syncs with computers and smartphones through wifi to transmit your fitness data in understandable 
    charts to monitor your progress</p>
<h2>Barcelona - Smart Cities</h2>
<p>The Spanish city is one of the foremost smart cities in the world after it implemented several IoT
    initiatives that have helped enhance smart parking and the environment.</p>
<h2>AT&T - Connected Car</h2>
<p>: AT&T was the first telecom company to open a connected car research and innovation center.</p>
